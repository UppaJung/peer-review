## Background

Yet, even if were were to focus exclusionary peer review entirely on scientific integrity, restricting what others can publish does not serve science. Limiting publications may have been necessary financial constraints on how much could be published: when research was printed on paper, traveled by mail, and took up space on shelves. As publishing costs approached zero and the information available to us grew exponentially, we acquired new tools to filter the deluge of information competing for our attention, such as search engines and social sharing. We no longer need peer reviewers to be arbiters of fashion, curating which research is worthy of modeling on science's most exclusive runways and which to leave hanging backstage. 


While we could reform peer review to exclude works only for reasons of scientific integrity, the function of limiting what can be published is now a vestigial. *Exclusionary* peer review was once necessary due to financial constraints on how much could be published: when research was printed on paper, traveled by mail, and took up space on shelves. As publishing costs approached zero and the information available to us grew exponentially, we acquired new tools to filter the deluge of information competing for our attention, such as search engines and social sharing. We no longer need peer reviewers to be arbiters of fashion, curating which research is worthy of modeling on science's most exclusive runways and which to leave hanging backstage. 




Using elucidative peer review, we could even submit our experimental methodology for feedback, using reviewers' insights to improve those experimental designs *prior* to running experiments and reporting results. We could then seek further feedback after completing the research. Currently, peer review only reveals experimental design flaws after we have spent all the resources needed to run an experiment, and often after key co-authors have graduated or started other jobs.




disagree with those who review our work, as we do today. We may choose to rebut their concerns within the work or through separate commentary. As reviewers, we can assist authors by noting if we find others' reviews inaccurate or prejudicial. We may also weigh in even when not formally reviewing, either through our reviewing systems or through other means of public discourse. Elucidating disagreements amongst scientists gives our audience a more accurate and nuanced view of how science works than summarizing it into a single ‘*accept*’ or ‘*reject*’ decision.
