# Peer Review Should *Elucidate*, not *Exclude*.

When we practice of *exclusionary* peer review, in which we decide which of our peers' work to publish and which to reject, we fail to serve peer review's purported purpose of protecting scientific integrity.

We fail to protect scientific integrity, in part, because we currently use peer review to rank research relative to competing work and, by extension, [to rank our fellow scientists](#to-rank-each-other). The peer review committees we serve on are run by journals and conferences, each of which has its own brand, and which use exclusivity to signal brand prestige. Exclusivity necessitates adding criteria beyond scientific integrity, and those criteria inevitably conflict with integrity and subvert it.

We have also failed to prove we are reliable judges of integrity, or any acceptance criteria. While there's little evidence available, in the few well-designed experiments that test exclusionary peer review, [half of the works accepted by one review were rejected by a parallel review](./Notes.md#replicability). 

Even if we were to limit the criteria used by *exclusionary* peer review were to those of scientific integrity, compressing the many dimensions of integrity into a boolean is perilously lossy. Acceptances are inevitably misconstrued as endorsements, though many mask important concerns that were outweighed by a work's strength. Rejections needed to prevent one result from misleading may suppress other valuable results in the same work. Further, rejections conceal authors' missteps from those who learn from them and others who might might study scientific missteps.

If we use peer review to exclude works in which missteps and limitations are apparent, we discourage authors from reporting those missteps. If we allow peer review to accept work with missteps and limitations, so long as they are apparent to the audience, then peer review need never be *exclusionary*.

Instead, we can practice *elucidative* peer review, in which reviewers do not decide whether a work should be published. Rather, reviewers share insights for the work's audience, to ensure that audience is aware of the work's limitations and is not otherwise mislead by the work. *Elucidative* peer review obligates authors to share those reviews when publishing their work as "peer reviewed" (see [notes](./Notes.md#publishing-reviews) for details).

*Elucidative* peer review speeds the flow of scientific discourse. Reviewers can provide feedback faster, because they don't need to compare a work to other research competing for acceptances, or to discuss whether the work should be accepted with other reviewers[*](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delaying-the-spread-of-knowledge). Authors thus receive feedback, and can revise their work, while their [memories are fresher](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delays-disrupt-memory). If the same reviewers can review revisions, they can evaluate them more quickly. Authors do not need to slog through multiple rounds of rejections to publish their work as peer reviewed.

<!-- We can publish whenever we have addressed reviewers' concerns to our satisfaction. (Whether reviewers or the audience are satisfied is for them to decide.) -->

<!-- So as to focus on the benefits of *elucidative* peer review, I document the [harms of *exclusionary* peer review]() separately and only allude to them here. I will explain why elucidative peer review benefits us all whether we are consuming research, authoring research, reviewing research, as well as participation in science and broader trust in science. -->

## How we benefit, as authors, when publishing research

<!-- <a id="faster"></a>*Elucidative* peer review is [faster than *exclusionary* peer review](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delaying-the-spread-of-knowledge). When we are ready to submit work, we do not need for a deadline when others will be submitting competing work, and reviewers' feedback need not be withheld until our work can be compared with others' work, or for reviewers' feedback compared with others' reviews. This means we can act on feedback sooner, while [our memories are fresher](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delays-disrupt-memory). We can publish whenever we have addressed reviewers' concerns to our satisfaction. (Whether reviewers or the audience are satisfied is for them to decide.) -->

<a id="research-audience"></a>When preparing work for elucidative peer review, we have the latitude to write to best serve our audience. When we write to defend against rejection, we make our work [less readable](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#audience).

<!-- as opposed to minimizing our risk of rejection. Defensive writing encourages us to fawn over tangentially-related  work written by likely reviewers from our subfield, regardless of that work's quality or true relevance; to dedicate paragraphs to promoting the importance of our work to reviewers whose interests took them to different subfields; and to bulk up citation counts to signal our domain expertise to all reviewers. -->

In aggregate, we can expect more constructive and positive feedback from *elucidative* peer review, because reviewers do not need to [concoct reasons to reject the majority of papers](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md/#negative-feedback).

We will still get negative feedback, some of which we may disagree with. We will be obligated to share feedback with disagree with along with our work. We can, however, rebut feedback we disagree with, publish, and let the rest of the scientific community weigh in.

## How we benefit as reviewers of others' research

Whereas exclusionary peer review demands that scientists pass final judgements, *elucidative* peer review only requires them to use the skills already essential to them as authors: examining others' research and explaining it to others.

When reviewing, we can not only elucidate concerns to share with those who might learn about the work (as journalists are limited to), but we can attempt to persuade authors to revise their work to address those concerns. It is better for authors to eliminate our causes for concern, or disclose those concerns on their own, than for the audience to only learn about the concerns from our reviews. (When authors address our concerns, we can remove those concerns from our reviews or note if we are satisfied with authors' changes.)

participating in elucidative peer review allows us to perform a service to authors, and to serve science more broadly, without being complicit in ranking and exclusion. Elucidative reviewing gives our reviews a higher purpose and broader audience than exclusionary reviewing. It also lightens our reviewing workloads, as authors need not resubmit their work repeatedly in search of reviewers who consider their work interesting enough to publish—each work needs only one set of reviewers.


## How we benefit as consumers of research

As consumers of research, elucidative peer review provides far more insight than learning only that a paper was accepted (or, for rejected papers, not even learning they ever existed). Like exclusionary [open peer review](FAQ.md#open-peer-review), we in the audience are privy to reviewers' feedback.

When authors opt for elucidative peer review, we consumers get access to peer-reviewed research and that's [written for us](#research-audience), not other reviewers, and we get access to it [faster](./Notes.md#faster). When reviewers do not have to write their reviews to support a position (*accept* or *reject*), they can be more objective. When they don't have to convince other reviewers to join their position, they can direct their insights to us, the work's full audience, as opposed to other experts.

We should also demand more control over the decisions that guide our access to research that interests us, rather than what others think we should find worth reading. For example, we could eschew conferences where an elite group of peer reviewers decide what which presentations we want to see, and instead opt for those that ask us which prospective presentations we would want to see and allocate speaker slots and lecture hall sizes to give the audience what we're actually interested in.


#### We can free ourselves from outcome bias

However, when reviewers have to make a decision to accept or reject research, and start favoring one of those two options during the review process, they may consciously or subconsciously start biasing their collection and presentation of evidence to support the position they expect their review to take. Only by eliminating the decision entirely can we remove this bias.

Also, the choice to ‘*reject*’ research implies that there is also a decision to ‘*accept*’ it. Whenever we ‘*accept*’ research we risk that this act will be perceived as scientific consensus on correctness, when in fact it would only mean that none of a small number of experts found sufficient reason to reject it. Science takes a long time to build consensus around our confidence in results. When the public prematurely concludes finality and correctness, then sees conflicting results later also endorsed with an ‘*accept*’, they may lose faith in science.

#### We can free ourselves from reviewing work others have already provided sufficient feedback on
Having countless exclusionary peer review committees of different strata also burdens us with unnecessary work as reviewers. We must re-review papers that had already met scientific-integrity requirements when previously rejected. Our efforts to provide constructive feedback are discarded by authors who assume that what their work really needs is a new set of reviewers with different subjective expectations.

#### We don't have to participate in the culture of rejection




## Benefits for science



#### The body of published results will be less biased
**Excluding research biases the body of published results**. Submissions that confirm the hopes and beliefs of reviewers are more likely to be accepted than those that defy reviewers' expectations or dash their hopes. Among the many consequences of *publication bias* the potential for false discovery, especially when peer review committees deem null results unworthy of publication. If twenty research teams test an attractive but ineffective intervention, we can expect 19 teams to find no significant difference and fail to publish. We can expect one of twenty to find specious support the attractive-but-false hypothesis that the intervention is effective (at least at p<0.05)—and get published.

#### Peer review will mean what we say it means
**Stratification built on exclusionary peer review undermines scientific standards**. Every journal and conference has different standards of acceptance. Many journals and conferences publish work they know to be flawed to meet financial or attendance goals. The lowest strata publications may provide the pretense of peer review while accepting any paper for which authors pay publication fees. Even the most prestigious conferences in my field are known to override some reviewer's integrity concerns if others believe the work will draw attention that might otherwise go to competing conferences. Yet, many outsiders are unfamiliar with these different standards, or are unaware that scientific standards vary so broadly depending on the publication.
