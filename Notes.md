#### Regarding “*the social contract of elucidative peer review*’"
Peer review committees may choose to formalize this social contract by requiring authors to commit to linking their published paper to the reviews.
<!-- Is this contractual upon requesting reviews? -->

#### Regarding “*what we are actually doing when we peer review research is…to rank our fellow scientists relative to each other*”
Scientists' ability to hurl research over the gates of exclusionary peer review determines our career trajectory in science's stratification system. We signal our success on our curriculum vitaes by listing each paper with the brand of the journal or conference that accepted it.

#### Regarding “*half of papers accepted by one review were rejected by a parallel review*”

Past attempts to test whether peer include the [The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/), and its 2014 predecessor, which duplicated the review process for a fraction of papers. Per the 2021 report:

> In 2014, 49.5% of the papers accepted by the first committee were rejected by the second (with a fairly wide confidence interval as the experiment included only 116 papers).  This year, this number was 50.6%.

The high quality of the experimental is noteworthy for its attempt to *minimize* differences between the replica review processes. The replication took place in parallel, as part of the same conference peer review process. Again, in their words:

> During the assignment phase of the review process, we chose 10% of papers uniformly at random—we’ll refer to these as the “duplicated papers.”  We assigned two Area Chairs (ACs) and twice the normal number of reviewers to these papers.  With the help and guidance of the team at OpenReview, we then created a copy of each of these papers and split the ACs and reviewers at random between the two copies.  We made sure that the two ACs were assigned to two different Senior Area Chairs (SACs) so that no SAC handled both copies of the same paper.  Any newly invited reviewer for one copy was automatically added as a conflict for the other copy.  We’ll refer to the SAC, AC, and reviewers assigned to the same copy as the copy’s “committee.”  The papers’ committees were not told about the experiment and were not aware the paper had been duplicated.

This methodology assured that papers were reviewed to a single peer review committee's reviewing standards and with reviewers from the same pool of candidates (a reviewer might be reviewing a paper from replica A and a different paper for replica B).

When authors re-submit their work to different conferences, other factors that might lead to different outcomes include the different reviewing traditions and expectations between different journals or conferences, different pools of reviewers, the publication of related work in the intervening time, and changes in what research is fashionable over the passage of time.

#### Regarding “*researchers are pressured by reviewers to go beyond factual reporting*”
As an example of how exclusionary peer review pressures authors to speculate beyond their factual findings, I will quote two of the three reviewers from my recent co-authored submission to the *2022 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security*.

Reviewer B complained that data tables with the exact wording survey questions and answers be replaced with charts to make space for the “*critical reflection of the results and a discussion of the larger implications of the results.*”

Reviewer C wrote “*I'd like to read the authors' thoughts about the findings and how they inform future research and product development.*”

#### Regarding “*procedural television dramas*”

The justice system's clear separation of duties between investigation and advocacy (prosecution) has been drilled into the public's awareness for over two decades by the ubiquitous procedural television drama [Law and Order](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order) and its spin-offs. Each episode starts with following introductory narration:
>In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.
