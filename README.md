# Peer Review Should *Elucidate*, not *Exclude*.

The scientific practice of *exclusionary* peer review, in which we decide which of our peers' work to publish and which to reject, is unfixable. We can and should be replace it.

For one, it fails to serving its supposedly-intended purpose: protecting scientific integrity of research. We actually use it to rank research relative to competing work and, by extension, [to rank our fellow scientists](to-rank-each-other). The peer review committees we serve on are run by journals and conferences, each of which has its own brand, and which signal brand prestige by *excluding* a significant portion of submissions. Increasing exclusivity necessitates adding criteria beyond scientific integrity, which inevitably conflict with integrity and subvert it. We're also not good at it. Our faith in our reliability as judges is contradicted by evidence from well-designed experiments, in which [half of papers accepted by one review were rejected by a parallel review](./Notes.md#replicability). 

Yet, even if were were to focus exclusionary peer review entirely on scientific integrity, restricting what others can publish does not serve science. Limiting publications may have been necessary financial constraints on how much could be published: when research was printed on paper, traveled by mail, and took up space on shelves. As publishing costs approached zero and the information available to us grew exponentially, we acquired new tools to filter the deluge of information competing for our attention, such as search engines and social sharing. We no longer need peer reviewers to be arbiters of fashion, curating which research is worthy of modeling on science's most exclusive runways and which to leave hanging backstage. 

We should instead conduct peer review, and address scientific integrity, *without* asserting power over what others can and cannot publish. We should perform *elucidative* peer review: examining our peers' work and detailing our findings for their eventual audience, especially as they relate to the work's integrity. We can use our words to protect the audience from being mislead, rather than censoring that which we fear might mislead them.

<!-- Perhaps for the slide version of this talk "Runways are an odd slightly-raised surface for scientists to choose to die on." or "When I ask fellow scientists whether they really want to be arbiters of fashion, I'm often surprised how many will choose a runway as the hill they're willing to die on." -->

In this article, I will explain why elucidative peer review benefits us all whether we are consuming research, authoring research, reviewing research, as well as participation in science and broader trust in science.

## Background


While we could reform peer review to exclude works only for reasons of scientific integrity, the function of limiting what can be published is now a vestigial. *Exclusionary* peer review was once necessary due to financial constraints on how much could be published: when research was printed on paper, traveled by mail, and took up space on shelves. As publishing costs approached zero and the information available to us grew exponentially, we acquired new tools to filter the deluge of information competing for our attention, such as search engines and social sharing. We no longer need peer reviewers to be arbiters of fashion, curating which research is worthy of modeling on science's most exclusive runways and which to leave hanging backstage.

## How we benefit, as authors, when publishing research

The [social contract of elucidative peer review](./Notes.md#social-contract) requires us, as authors, to share the reviews our work receives with our audience when we publish it. If we want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond, we must also share the last version(s) reviewed by each reviewer, illuminating what we have changed since they last weighed in.

<a id="faster"></a>We can publish peer-reviewed research faster than we would have to if [we needed to wait for a common submission deadline, wait for reviewers to read a pool of research to rank, and then await their coordination to reach an outcome.](./The-Problems-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delaying-the-spread-of-knowledge) We can get feedback from each reviewer the moment they are ready to share it, and we can publish whenever we are confident that we have convinced our audience that we have sufficiently addressed reviewers' concerns to our satisfaction. Receiving feedback faster means we can act on it sooner, while our memories of how we conducted our research and our familiarity with how we presented it are fresher in our mind, whereas [our memories will be further degraded if we must wait for feedback from exclusionary peer review](./The-Problems-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delays-disrupt-memory).

<a id="research-audience"></a>Preparing work for elucidative peer review allows us to write for our intended audience, prioritizing scientific content over reviewers' subjective interests. We can expect feedback to be more constructive and timely.
We can write for to meet the needs of our intended general audience, not [to impress and placate the egos of potential experts reviewers as we do for exclusionary peer review](./The-Problems-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#we-write-for-reviewers-not-our-intended-audience). We don't have to make results look [more significant or impactful to get published](./The-Problems-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#FIXME).  We can include details of experimental design that are necessary for our research to be reproduced, but that reviewers might find uninteresting or tedious.

Using elucidative peer review, we could even submit our experimental methodology for feedback, using reviewers' insights to improve those experimental designs *prior* to running experiments and reporting results. We could then seek further feedback after completing the research. Currently, peer review only reveals experimental design flaws after we have spent all the resources needed to run an experiment, and often after key co-authors have graduated or started other jobs.

We get more positive feedback, because reviewers do not need to concoct reasons to reject papers, whereas [exclusionary peer review must reject some papers of sufficient scientific integrity](./The-Problems-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md/#negative-feedback).

We will still get negative feedback. We may disagree with those who review our work, as we do today. We may choose to rebut their concerns within the work or through separate commentary. As reviewers, we can assist authors by noting if we find others' reviews inaccurate or prejudicial. We may also weigh in even when not formally reviewing, either through our reviewing systems or through other means of public discourse. Elucidating disagreements amongst scientists gives our audience a more accurate and nuanced view of how science works than summarizing it into a single ‘*accept*’ or ‘*reject*’ decision.


## How we benefit as reviewers of others' research

Whereas exclusionary peer review demands that scientists pass final judgements, *elucidative* peer review only requires them to use the skills already essential to them as authors: examining others' research and explaining it to others.

When reviewing, we can not only elucidate concerns to share with those who might learn about the work (as journalists are limited to), but we can attempt to persuade authors to revise their work to address those concerns. It is better for authors to eliminate our causes for concern, or disclose those concerns on their own, than for the audience to only learn about the concerns from our reviews. (When authors address our concerns, we can remove those concerns from our reviews or note if we are satisfied with authors' changes.)

participating in elucidative peer review allows us to perform a service to authors, and to serve science more broadly, without being complicit in ranking and exclusion. Elucidative reviewing gives our reviews a higher purpose and broader audience than exclusionary reviewing. It also lightens our reviewing workloads, as authors need not resubmit their work repeatedly in search of reviewers who consider their work interesting enough to publish—each work needs only one set of reviewers.

#### We can free ourselves from outcome bias

However, when reviewers have to make a decision to accept or reject research, and start favoring one of those two options during the review process, they may consciously or subconsciously start biasing their collection and presentation of evidence to support the position they expect their review to take. Only by eliminating the decision entirely can we remove this bias.

Also, the choice to ‘*reject*’ research implies that there is also a decision to ‘*accept*’ it. Whenever we ‘*accept*’ research we risk that this act will be perceived as scientific consensus on correctness, when in fact it would only mean that none of a small number of experts found sufficient reason to reject it. Science takes a long time to build consensus around our confidence in results. When the public prematurely concludes finality and correctness, then sees conflicting results later also endorsed with an ‘*accept*’, they may lose faith in science.

#### We can free ourselves from reviewing work others have already provided sufficient feedback on
Having countless exclusionary peer review committees of different strata also burdens us with unnecessary work as reviewers. We must re-review papers that had already met scientific-integrity requirements when previously rejected. Our efforts to provide constructive feedback are discarded by authors who assume that what their work really needs is a new set of reviewers with different subjective expectations.

#### We don't have to participate in the culture of rejection


## How we benefit as consumers of research

As consumers of research, elucidative peer review provides far more insight than learning only that a paper was accepted (or, for rejected papers, not even learning they ever existed). Like exclusionary [open peer review](FAQ.md#open-peer-review), the audience is privy to reviewers' feedback.

When authors opt for elucidative peer review, we consumers get access to peer-reviewed research and that's [written for us](#research-audience), not other reviewers, and we get access to it [faster](./Notes.md#faster). When reviewers do not have to write their reviews to support a position (*accept* or *reject*), they can be more objective. When they don't have to convince other reviewers to join their position, they can direct their insights to us, the work's full audience, as opposed to other experts.

We should also demand more control over the decisions that guide our access to research that interests us, rather than what others think we should find worth reading. For example, we could eschew conferences where an elite group of peer reviewers decide what which presentations we want to see, and instead opt for those that ask us which prospective presentations we would want to see and allocate speaker slots and lecture hall sizes to give the audience what we're actually interested in.


## Benefits for science



#### The body of published results will be less biased
**Excluding research biases the body of published results**. Submissions that confirm the hopes and beliefs of reviewers are more likely to be accepted than those that defy reviewers' expectations or dash their hopes. Among the many consequences of *publication bias* the potential for false discovery, especially when peer review committees deem null results unworthy of publication. If twenty research teams test an attractive but ineffective intervention, we can expect 19 teams to find no significant difference and fail to publish. We can expect one of twenty to find specious support the attractive-but-false hypothesis that the intervention is effective (at least at p<0.05)—and get published.

#### Peer review will mean what we say it means
**Stratification built on exclusionary peer review undermines scientific standards**. Every journal and conference has different standards of acceptance. Many journals and conferences publish work they know to be flawed to meet financial or attendance goals. The lowest strata publications may provide the pretense of peer review while accepting any paper for which authors pay publication fees. Even the most prestigious conferences in my field are known to override some reviewer's integrity concerns if others believe the work will draw attention that might otherwise go to competing conferences. Yet, many outsiders are unfamiliar with these different standards, or are unaware that scientific standards vary so broadly depending on the publication.
