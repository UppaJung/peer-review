#### Regarding “experiments in which papers were reviewed by two different sets of reviewers”

Past attempts to test whether peer include the [The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/), and its 2014 predecessor, which duplicated the review process for a fraction of papers.  Per the 2021 report:

> In 2014, 49.5% of the papers accepted by the first committee were rejected by the second (with a fairly wide confidence interval as the experiment included only 116 papers).  This year, this number was 50.6%.

#### Regarding “*researchers are pressured by reviewers to go beyond factual reporting*”
As an example of how exclusionary peer review pressures authors to speculate beyond their factual findings, I will quote two of the three reviewers from my recent co-authored submission to the *2022 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security*.

Reviewer B complained that data tables with the exact wording survey questions and answers be replaced with charts to make space for the "critical reflection of the results and a discussion of the larger implications of the results."

Reviewer C wrote "I'd like to read the authors' thoughts about the findings and how they inform future research and product development."

#### Regarding “*procedural television dramas*”
The long-running procedural television drama [Law and Order](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order) opened each episode with the narration:
>In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.
