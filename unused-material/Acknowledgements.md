<!-- Among other contributions, [Cormac Herley](https://cormac.herley.org/) was first to provide feedback and suggested the inclusion of Bishop's [*Rein in the four horsemen of irreproducibility*](./Recommended-Readings.md#Rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility) and [The natural selection of bad science](./Recommended-Readings.md#The-natural-selection-of-bad-science).

Among other contributions, [Sauvik Das](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/sauvik-das) suggested adding reference to [The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/).

[Jon Howell](https://research.vmware.com/researchers/jon-howell) provided a much-needed adversarial reading and insights from the computer systems reviewing community.

Conversations with [Michael D. Smith](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/michael-smith) encouraged me to think about *informative* peer review a structural, rather than cultural, change. -->
