#### Publishing reviews

The [social contract](./Notes.md#social-contract) of *informative* peer review requires authors who submit their work for review to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, illuminating what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.

This social contract may be informal, or peer review committees may formalize it as a condition of review.

Peer review committees or others may provide a platform on which the work and/or its reviews can be updated, or this process may be manual.

Informative peer review can be used with anonymous or named authors, and with anonymous, pseudonymous, or named reviewers. Naming authors prior to reviewers' initial review may make them less objective. Reviewers may be more comfortable being named by default given that they don't have to fear being blamed for rejecting a paper.

#### Differences with [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)?

The term ‘[open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)’ encompasses a range of practices are released to the public, including competitive peer review where authors of rejected papers have no obligation to share reviews if their work is later published.

The goal of this article is not coin new terms, as the excess of jargon created by scientists seeking ownership of the lexicon is also among science's sins. Rather, I hoped that giving a name to *competitive* and *informative* peer review would be useful in convincing my fellow scientists that the former is harmful and the latter is a real and compelling alternative.
