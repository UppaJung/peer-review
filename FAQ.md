# Answers to common/likely questions

#### What institutions(s) should run elucidative peer review?

Elucidative peer review should be run by an institution that is competent, has incentives aligned with the goals of science, and earns the trust of scientists and the public.  The correct institution may vary by field or subfield, as different fields and subfields are served by different institutions.

#### How should elucidative peer review be administered?

There are many choices to be made in administering peer review that also must be made in exclusive peer review, such as:

 - What should be the requirements for reviewers to serve?
 - What constitutes a conflicts of interest that must be disclosed, or that might disqualify a reviewer?
 - When work is submitted, how should reviewers be selected given candidates' varying expertise, objectivity, and availability for fast turn around?

These choices are not specific to elucidative peer review, and so this article takes no position on them.

#### How long should reviewers have to review papers?

Reviewing time is likely to vary with the supply of reviewers with sufficient expertise, their available time, and the demand for their time. This article is agnostic to this question, other than to note that reviewers will have more availability when papers are not submitted to committee after committee seeking acceptance.

#### Should peer reviewers get paid in elucidative peer review?

This article is agnostic to whether or what reviewers get paid.

#### Are authors and reviewers anonymous?
Elucidative peer review can be used with anonymous or named authors, and with anonymous, pseudonymous, or named reviewers. Naming authors prior to reviewers' initial review may make them less objective. Reviewers may be more comfortable being named by default given that they don't have to fear being blamed for rejecting a paper.

#### How is what you describe as elucidative peer review different from [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)?

The term ‘[open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)’ encompasses a range of practices including exclusionary peer review where reviews of only accepted papers are released to the public.

My goal in  was not to coin a new term, as the excess of jargon created by scientists seeking ownership of the lexicon is also among science's sins. Rather, I hoped that giving a name to *exclusionary* and *elucidative* peer review would be useful in convincing my fellow scientists ithat the former is harmful and the latter is a real and compelling alternative.

#### What role can journals play if authors adopt elucidative peer review?

Without the pretense of protecting scientific integrity, journals are effectively awards committees. Some people appreciate awards committees. Those scientists who do should feel free to contribute to them, while those scientists who do not should feel no obligation to do so.
