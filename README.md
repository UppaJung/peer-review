# What <u>You</u> Can Do to Fix Peer Review

Scientific peer review need not, and should not, produce scores. Assigning a score to a work does not help its authors to improve it, nor does it help the work's audience understand the work and its limitations. Rather, scoring is a vestigial function of peer review that reduces our objectivity and undermines peer review's scientific functions.

Scoring reduces our objectivity by amplifying our implicit biases: we are predisposed to appreciate works that are familiar in approach, language, and style to our own work; we trust results more easily when they confirm our existing beliefs and hopes. Scoring requires us to evaluate how much the work deserves to be trusted, recognized, or otherwise valued, which we cannot quantify without activating our biases. We cannot stop these biases from propagating from our scores to our written feedback. We may try to be objective, such as by ensuring every word we write is backed by facts, but we can only report a small fraction of the facts we observe, and facts will seem more salient when they confirm the fairness of our scoring intentions.

Despite the hazards of scoring others' work, assigning *accept* and *reject* scores is the principal function of the most widely-available form of peer review: *publication review*. Different journals and conferences may conducting reviews using different criteria and intermediate scoring systems, but they ultimately reach a binary conclusion as to whether to publish a work.

The scant evidence available certainly does not suggest that we assign *accepts* and *rejects* objectively. In experiments by the NeuroIPS conference in 2014 and again in 2021, half of the works selected for acceptance by one set of peer reviewers were rejected by parallel sets of reviewers.[^consistency] It's fashionable to refer to this inconsistency as *randomness*, but doing so is unscientific and harmful, perpetuating the assumption that our inconsistency is unbiased (uniformly distributed) and diminishes in impact over time and scale. The word ‘randomness’ implicitly rejects the possibility of systemic biases, such as those against underrepresented researchers and unpopular ideas, which grow worse as today's publication reviews determine who survives to become tomorrow's publication reviewers.[^selection-of-scientists]

Reviewing work without scoring it cannot make us unbiased, but excising scoring does removes a trigger that activates our biases and the pressure to write feedback that justifies those scores. It can make science at least a little more objective, equitable, and just.

And, *scoreless* peer review can serve the two *scientific* purposes we most often use to motivate why we review others' work: helping authors to improve their research work and helping their audience understand their work and evaluate its credibility. We need not score work to provide insights that assist authors and their audience.

#### Author-assistive review

When we scrutinize the work of students and colleagues catch errors, offer clarifications, and suggest other ways to make their work better, we are informally conducting *author-assistive* peer review. We may ask others to do the same for us. Scoring rarely plays a role, even when we are seeking feedback in preparation for publication review.

Alas, there is unintended harm in the social norm of offering author-assistive review only to those close to us, and reviewing everyone else's work primarily through publication review: author-assistive review far less accessible than publication review. A field's insiders have fast access to constructive feedback, whereas outsiders may wait months longer only to receive feedback that is written to justify a rejection outcome rather than help them.[^mostly-rejections]

If we want to ensure our well-intentioned service to others does not unwittingly disadvantage underrepresented groups and other outsiders, we should each make ourselves at least as accessible for *author-assistive* peer review as we are for publication review.[^pre-experimental-review] Put more simply, we should be as available to help others as to judge them. (I'll explain just how easy this is below in the section titled "[What You Can Do <u>Right Now</u>](#rightnow)".)

#### Audience-assistive review

Evaluating the credibility of research work is also a goal we can achieve through scoreless peer review, as using publication review for this purpose is problematic. Publications' acceptance criteria include factors such as ‘novelty’ and ‘significance’ that are not only unrelated to credibility, but subvert it by rewarding unscientific practices and chance results.[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes] Acceptances are too often misconstrued as endorsements that lead readers to overlook key limitations. Outright fraud is rarely detected by publication review and often benefits from its endorsement. And, since publication review requires scoring, under-represented groups and other outsiders will find it harder to establish that their work is credible through publication than insiders will.

*Audience-assistive peer review* is the scoreless approach to examine a work's credibility. Our goal as reviewers it to provide feedback addressed to the work's audience to help them understand the work and any issues that might impact its credibility.[^information-asymmetries] Sharing nuanced written feedback presents us the opportunity to differentiate extremely meticulous findings from those that are somewhat credible, those that are glaringly wrong, and everything in between.[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished] We can help the audience develop the skills to identify strengths and weaknesses of research results themselves. And while audience-assistive reviewing will never be free from bias, and even credibility is subjective,[^subjective-credibility] the reviews become part of science's open discourse, presenting opportunities for others to recognize and mitigate any bias that might go unaddressed if left within the shadow discourse of confidential publication review.[^open-peer-review]

Audience-assistive review has other benefits. It frees authors write to write for their audience, who will ultimately judge their work, rather than to appeal to reviewers.[^written-for-reviewers] We can share our reviews more quickly when we do not coordinate on final scoring outcomes (though we may still want to later update our feedback in response to others' insights).

We all stand to benefit if research an be vetted more quickly and objectively, and we will reduce the disadvantage that under-represented groups and outsiders have in establishing the credibility of their work through publication review.

#### What You Can Do <u>Right Now</u>

We each have a limited precious time to dedicate to service. We can spend our time scoring others or assisting others.[^time] At a bare minimum, we should make ourselves at least as accessible for scoreless peer review as we are for publication review.

You can do this right now. You don't need to wait for anyone else to agree. You don't need to wait for others to organize and invite you to new scoreless peer review panel.

**Simply update your webpage to signal you are "available to conduct scoreless peer review".** If you don't have a personal webpage but do have a blog or social media profile, update that instead. You can prefix the above phrase with conditionals like "try to be", or follow the above phrase with conditionals such as "when possible", but use "available to conduct scoreless peer review" to be discoverable via a web search on it (e.g. via [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22available+to+conduct+scoreless+peer+review%22) or [Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22available+to+conduct+scoreless+peer+review%22)).[^author-only]  You can add conditions, such as which topic areas you feel qualified and interested in reviewing and any you do not want to review.[^fees] (My declaration is on [my blog's about page](https://www.stuartschechter.org/about#scoreless-peer-review).)

Signalling your availability should not only be easy to do, but it should also be easy to undo if you change your mind.

Signalling your availability will make an immediate difference. Even if none of your peers join you, authors who may not otherwise have access to assistive review will now be able to find you. You now at least have the option to help, and those you choose to help may eventually become peers. If enough of your peers signal their availability, your field will be able to start forming review panels to formalize scoreless peer review. It all starts with you signalling your openness to scoreless peer review.

[^time]: If you are worried about the time required, consider that scoreless peer review could actually reduce all of our workloads. As more work is submitted for publication having already benefited from scoreless review, with its credibility already evaluated, less of that work may need to be rejected. Consider that work submitted to review committees with acceptance rates of 25% will require an expectation of four submissions to be published, consuming the time of four sets of reviewers. Increasing the probability of acceptance to 34% reduces the expected number of submissions by one (from 4 to 3), removing the expected review workload by an entire set of reviewers. Further, if publication review is no longer needed to establish the credibility of work, more conferences could forgo using peer reviewers to choose which works they think attendees will want to see and, instead, ask prospective attendees which works they actually want to see.

#### Scoreless Review is a First Step to Fixing Publication Review

Scoreless peer review alone will not fix what we think of as peer review.

While *science* is a collective search for truth, the *industry of science* is fiercely competitive. Our institutions are stratified into tiers and jobs within those institutions are further stratified into more tiers. Industrial science uses publications to rank us for hiring, promotions, and compensation. Most of us have no choice but to submit our work for publication review because we, or are co-authors, are part of that industry and must publish in the "right places" to survive in it.

Scoreless peer review *cannot* magically eliminate the biases and inequities of industrialized science.

What scoreless peer review *can* do is empower us serve authors and their audience – to serve science – without ranking each other and perpetuating the inequities of industrialized science. Scoreless peer review *can* also help undermine the pretense that publication review serves science—that we need to play these zero-sum games to improve research quality and protect scientific integrity. Scoreless peer review can demonstrate that this seemingly-necessary evil is not actually necessary.

[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes]: Evaluating experiments by their outcomes encourages authors to highlight those hypotheses that yielded statistically significant results than those that didn't, hypothesize potentially significant results only after seeing data [(HARKing)](./Recommended-Readings.md#harking-hypothesizing-after-the-results-are-known), and to engage in [other irresponsible scientific practices](./Recommended-Readings.md#rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility).

[^consistency]: [The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/) followed the earlier experiment at [NIPS 2014](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/CallForPapers) (the conference would be renamed NeurIPS). The 2014 call for papers stated “submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity” whereas the 2021 call for papers listed no evaluation criteria.

[^mostly-rejections]: Since journals and conferences compete to be exclusive, those submitting to the publications with the most experts can expect the highest rejection rates.

[^pre-experimental-review]: We should also offer to assist authors *before* they conduct experiments, helping them refine their hypotheses and improve their experimental designs prior to incurring the risks, costs, and time the experiments require. The current practice of reviewing and rejecting experimental designs at publication time, after the costs of conducting the experiment have been sunk, is wasteful and frustrating for all involved. Pre-experimental review and registration of experimental designs can increase the chance that null results will be published. A [2018 examination](https://psyarxiv.com/3czyt) of 127 bio-medical and psychological science registered reports (pre-registered studies) showed a 61% null result rate, as opposed to a typical 5-20% null result rate for studies published in venues that did not require pre-registration.

[^subjective-credibility]: Even *credibility* is inherently subjective. Consider an experiment that attempts to prove a hypothesis by rejecting a null hypothesis. The experiment does not consider or attempt to test a third hypothesis that would also lead the null hypothesis to be rejected. If a reviewer considers that third hypothesis sufficiently implausible, the third hypothesis does not impact the credibility of the experiment. If a reviewer considers the third hypothesis sufficiently plausible, they might conclude that the experiment should have been designed to disprove it as well.

[^open-peer-review]: There are forms of publication review that open up some of their discourse, such as [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review), in which the reviews of accepted papers become public.

<!-- [^social-contract]: The social contract of informative peer review requires authors to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, informing their audience of what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.  While the requirement to share reviews burdens authors who receive feedback they believe to be misleading or outright malicious, they can rebut that feedback themselves or ask other reviewers, or even outside experts, to do so. -->

[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]: Further, when rejected work goes unpublished they disappear from scientific discourse, we can't learn from any mistakes that were made, and so the same mistakes and failed experiments can be re-run over and over. We bias research in favor of chance results.

[^written-for-reviewers]: Research works today are often more written for reviewers than a work's true audience, at a cost both to that audience and to authors. For example, reviewers' expectations for ever-increasing numbers of cited works, and our need to exceed their expectations for citation counts when submitting work, have caused the number of citations to grow out of hand. Bibliographies have evolved like peacocks' trains: vast assemblies of plumage, most of which serve no function but to attract the admiration of those who co-evolved to prize it.


[^anonymity]: The corrupting influence of power to score others' work can be compounded when we exercise that power anonymously. Audience-assistive peer review can be performed anonymously, but there may be less reason to when reviews do not produce scores or outcomes.

[^selection-of-scientists]: In [The natural selection of bad science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160384), Smaldino and McElreath argue that  that publication review also favors scientists whose “poor” methods “produce the greatest number of publishable results” which leads to “increasingly high false discovery rates”. 

[^information-asymmetries]: Whereas publication review can reinforce knowledge asymmetries, audience-assistive feedback is designed to reduce knowledge asymmetries, reducing the knowledge gap between authors and audience.


<!-- [^fashion-shows]: Treating publication review as *scientific service* requires us to believe that what we are doing is fundamentally different from those who select which fashions to display on a runway.  -->

[^author-only]: If you are not willing to perform both author- and audience-assistive peer review, I'd suggest "available to conduct author-assistive peer review" or "available to conduct audience-assistive peer review".

[^fees]: Peer review as unpaid (volunteer) service has been a norm in much of the scientific community. Yet, author-assistive reviews are often performed colleagues at the same employer, or collaborators who are on the same grants, and so are often implicitly paid. We need to be understanding that reviewers may reasonably expect to be paid when reviewing industrial research and research by authors who are as well compensated, if not better compensated, than the reviewer is.
