# Peer Review in Service to Science

Scientific peer review should *advance* science. It should promote and protect the integrity of scientific research by identifying missteps, errors, and other causes for concern that might otherwise go undetected or undisclosed. It should empower authors with others' expertise and insights to make us better scientists and communicators.

But the rituals we call “peer review” often *hinder* science, not advance it.

 <!-- We practice exclusionary peer review because of the collective illusion that is is somehow necessary for science. -->

We often practice peer review to rank research for ‘*significance*’, and distribute prestige, under the pretense of protecting scientific integrity. We do this by submitting research to, and serving on, peer review committees run by journals and conferences that use exclusivity to build brand cachet. Exclusivity necessitates ‘*significance*’ criteria beyond scientific integrity, which inevitably competes with integrity and [undermines](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md) it. We practice these ‘scientific’ rituals despite little scientific evidence that we are reliable judges; in the few well-designed experiments testing review, [half of the works accepted by one review were rejected by a parallel review](./Notes.md#replicability). 

Yet, we could not objectively categorize works into *accepts* and *rejects*  even if scientific integrity were our only review criteria.

There are many dimensions to scientific integrity, and compressing them into a boolean is lossy and perilous. Acceptances are inevitably misconstrued as endorsements, though accepted works are rarely without limitations and shortcomings that many readers will miss. Rejections censor valuable results for being bundled with those that raised reviewers' concerns. Rejections also conceal authors' missteps from those who might study or learn from them, making it harder for science to learn from our collective mistakes.

Further, holding power over whether a work will published cannot help but bias us as reviewers. Knowing that we are subject to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), we must assume that, the moment we start leaning toward an accept or reject outcome, we may unknowingly favor observations that support that outcome. We may subconsciously suppress reporting facts that run counter to our supported outcome, and that would subvert the certainty that the outcome is just, as those facts create a dissonance with our views of ourselves as fair and just.

We need to re-evaluate the very premise that we serve science by practicing *exclusionary* peer review, wielding the power to decide whether or where a work is published. The surest way to avoid the corrupting influence of power when reviewing others' work is to abdicate that power. The surest way to avoid the hazards of compressing a work's integrity into boolean *accepts* and *rejects* is not to do so—or at least not to do so under the pretense of serving science.

Peer review does not need to be exclusionary to identify missteps, errors, and other causes for concern that might otherwise go undetected. Nor are rejections needed ensure those concerns don't go undisclosed. We can instead make a condition of peer review that authors publish our reviews when they publish their work.

Our job as expert reviewers would then be to *elucidate* our concerns and other insights for the works' audience, ensuring the audience is not disadvantaged by lacking expertise or the time to read as diligently as we are expected to when reviewing. For work we would have once rejected, we could convey convey our concerns and lack of credence to the work's audience (though that audience will not see our reviews if authors choose not to publish). For work work we find to be particularly meticulous and credible, we can convey how it exceeds what would have once been our minimal standards for *accept*.

Abdicating the power to coerce authors to revise their work would not preclude us from encouraging them to improve the work we review. We could do so with constructive and persuasive feedback, along with promise to update our reviews.

*Elucidative* peer review serves scientific integrity because it removes perverse incentives that encourage authors to downplay missteps or overstate *significance* to avoid rejection. It also would make scientific discourse more **understandable**, **efficient**, **faster**, **kinder**, more **inclusive**.



Were we accustomed to *elucidative* peer review, we would expect scientific discourse to progress at a much faster rate than it can today. We would be accustomed to results being published after rounds of feedback between authors and a single set of reviewers. Adopting *exclusionary* peer review adds 3-6 months for every cycle of rejection and re-submission.

<!-- Given how invested most of us are in the tradition of *exclusionary* peer review, and the journals, conferences, hiring systems, and promotions systems built around this ritual, it can be difficult to imagine adopting a peer review custom that does not give us the power to reject others' work and does not confer prestige as part of evaluating scientific integrity. So, before discussing the path to adopting *elucidative* peer review, consider what we would think of *exclusionary* peer review if *elucidative* reviewer were our  current custom.
 -->




New results would be delayed for years while work is rejected and re-submitted over and over. 

 be balk at how *exclusionary* peer review would slow the speed of scientific discourse. We would ask how science is served by adopting a cycle in which we must re-submit rejected papers to new peer reviewers, over and over. We would not be accustomed to long waits between submitting our work and getting feedback, because reviewers wouldn't need to compare research to competing works, or debate its worthiness with other reviewers, before sharing it with us. We would be accustomed to getting feedback while our [memories are fresher](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delays-disrupt-memory), when we can best act on it.

<!-- If we didn't have to write reviews to support an *accept* or *reject* decision, we would less likely to bias ourselves in selecting the points salient to include in our reviews. -->

<!-- even if authors fail to address them, we could -->


<!-- that science is advanced by giving peer reviewers power to *exclude* others' work from publication is a collective illusion.

If our goal is to ensure that missteps, errors, and other problems don't go undisclosed, we should not reject papers for any shortcomings disclosed by authors—incentives for authors to hide problems subvert scientific integrity. In fact, we should reconsider whether, when we review our peers' work, we should hold the power to decide if it should be published. It is not the only way for peer reviewers to ensure problems don't go undisclosed. -->

<!-- If we required authors to publish peer reviews along with their work, we could write reviews that elucidate our concerns in language accessible to the audience of the research.

Such *elucidative* peer review would require participating authors to share those reviews when they publish their work (see [notes](./Notes.md#publishing-reviews) for details). -->



Eliminating the cycle of rejection and re-submission would also save time and effort for both authors and reviewers. Diligent authors may take great pains to revise work for re-submission to a new peer review committee with different members, expectations, interests, and paper formatting rule. Even if work is unchanged, each such re-submission requires a new set of reviewers to replicate the work of prior reviewers from scratch. Authors should still incorporate feedback nad improve their work, but reviewers who have already read the work and provided that feedback can evaluate those changes more efficiently than new ones.

But beyond being faster, and saving effort, *elucidative* peer review would change the audience that both authors and reviewers write for, to everyone's benefit. In *exclusionary* peer review, authors write to convince reviewers their work is [worthy of acceptance](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#audience), and reviewers write to convince other reviewers to either accept or reject. *Elucidative* peer review would free authors to write for their true audience, and give reviewers the opportunity to write for a larger audience as well.

We could expect more constructive and positive feedback from *elucidative* peer review, at least in aggregate, because reviewers would not need to [concoct reasons to reject the majority of papers](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md/#negative-feedback).

We would still get negative feedback, some of which we may disagree with. We would be obligated to share feedback with disagree with along with our work. We could, however, rebut feedback we disagree with and publish, allowing the broader scientific community to evaluate the merits of each position.


<!-- Authors write to persuade reviewers their work is worthy publishing, which may not serve their [true audience](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#audience). Reviewers write to justify for the score or outcome they will advocate for when discussing the paper with other reviewers. 
 -->

<!-- We can publish whenever we have addressed reviewers' concerns to our satisfaction. (Whether reviewers or the audience are satisfied is for them to decide.) -->

<!-- So as to focus on the benefits of *elucidative* peer review, I document the [harms of *exclusionary* peer review]() separately and only allude to them here. I will explain why elucidative peer review benefits us all whether we are consuming research, authoring research, reviewing research, as well as participation in science and broader trust in science. -->

## How we benefit, as authors, when publishing research

<!-- <a id="faster"></a>*Elucidative* peer review is [faster than *exclusionary* peer review](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delaying-the-spread-of-knowledge). When we are ready to submit work, we do not need for a deadline when others will be submitting competing work, and reviewers' feedback need not be withheld until our work can be compared with others' work, or for reviewers' feedback compared with others' reviews. This means we can act on feedback sooner, while [our memories are fresher](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#delays-disrupt-memory). We can publish whenever we have addressed reviewers' concerns to our satisfaction. (Whether reviewers or the audience are satisfied is for them to decide.) -->

<a id="research-audience"></a>When preparing work for elucidative peer review, we have the latitude to write to best serve our audience. When we write to defend against rejection, we make our work [less readable](./The-Harms-of-Exclusionary-Peer-Reivew.md#audience).

<!-- as opposed to minimizing our risk of rejection. Defensive writing encourages us to fawn over tangentially-related  work written by likely reviewers from our subfield, regardless of that work's quality or true relevance; to dedicate paragraphs to promoting the importance of our work to reviewers whose interests took them to different subfields; and to bulk up citation counts to signal our domain expertise to all reviewers. -->



## How we benefit as reviewers of others' research

Whereas exclusionary peer review demands that scientists pass final judgements, *elucidative* peer review only requires them to use the skills already essential to them as authors: examining others' research and explaining it to others.

When reviewing, we can not only elucidate concerns to share with those who might learn about the work (as journalists are limited to), but we can attempt to persuade authors to revise their work to address those concerns. It is better for authors to eliminate our causes for concern, or disclose those concerns on their own, than for the audience to only learn about the concerns from our reviews. (When authors address our concerns, we can remove those concerns from our reviews or note if we are satisfied with authors' changes.)

participating in elucidative peer review allows us to perform a service to authors, and to serve science more broadly, without being complicit in ranking and exclusion. Elucidative reviewing gives our reviews a higher purpose and broader audience than exclusionary reviewing. It also lightens our reviewing workloads, as authors need not resubmit their work repeatedly in search of reviewers who consider their work interesting enough to publish—each work needs only one set of reviewers.


## How we benefit as consumers of research

As consumers of research, elucidative peer review provides far more insight than learning only that a paper was accepted (or, for rejected papers, not even learning they ever existed). Like exclusionary [open peer review](FAQ.md#open-peer-review), we in the audience are privy to reviewers' feedback.

When authors opt for elucidative peer review, we consumers get access to peer-reviewed research and that's [written for us](#research-audience), not other reviewers, and we get access to it [faster](./Notes.md#faster). When reviewers do not have to write their reviews to support a position (*accept* or *reject*), they can be more objective. When they don't have to convince other reviewers to join their position, they can direct their insights to us, the work's full audience, as opposed to other experts.

We should also demand more control over the decisions that guide our access to research that interests us, rather than what others think we should find worth reading. For example, we could eschew conferences where an elite group of peer reviewers decide what which presentations we want to see, and instead opt for those that ask us which prospective presentations we would want to see and allocate speaker slots and lecture hall sizes to give the audience what we're actually interested in.


#### We can free ourselves from outcome bias

However, when reviewers have to make a decision to accept or reject research, and start favoring one of those two options during the review process, they may consciously or subconsciously start biasing their collection and presentation of evidence to support the position they expect their review to take. Only by eliminating the decision entirely can we remove this bias.

Also, the choice to ‘*reject*’ research implies that there is also a decision to ‘*accept*’ it. Whenever we ‘*accept*’ research we risk that this act will be perceived as scientific consensus on correctness, when in fact it would only mean that none of a small number of experts found sufficient reason to reject it. Science takes a long time to build consensus around our confidence in results. When the public prematurely concludes finality and correctness, then sees conflicting results later also endorsed with an ‘*accept*’, they may lose faith in science.

#### We can free ourselves from reviewing work others have already provided sufficient feedback on
Having countless exclusionary peer review committees of different strata also burdens us with unnecessary work as reviewers. We must re-review papers that had already met scientific-integrity requirements when previously rejected. Our efforts to provide constructive feedback are discarded by authors who assume that what their work really needs is a new set of reviewers with different subjective expectations.

#### We don't have to participate in the culture of rejection




## Benefits for science



#### The body of published results will be less biased
**Excluding research biases the body of published results**. Submissions that confirm the hopes and beliefs of reviewers are more likely to be accepted than those that defy reviewers' expectations or dash their hopes. Among the many consequences of *publication bias* the potential for false discovery, especially when peer review committees deem null results unworthy of publication. If twenty research teams test an attractive but ineffective intervention, we can expect 19 teams to find no significant difference and fail to publish. We can expect one of twenty to find specious support the attractive-but-false hypothesis that the intervention is effective (at least at p<0.05)—and get published.

#### Peer review will mean what we say it means
**Stratification built on exclusionary peer review undermines scientific standards**. Every journal and conference has different standards of acceptance. Many journals and conferences publish work they know to be flawed to meet financial or attendance goals. The lowest strata publications may provide the pretense of peer review while accepting any paper for which authors pay publication fees. Even the most prestigious conferences in my field are known to override some reviewer's integrity concerns if others believe the work will draw attention that might otherwise go to competing conferences. Yet, many outsiders are unfamiliar with these different standards, or are unaware that scientific standards vary so broadly depending on the publication.
