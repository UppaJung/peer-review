<!-- Using peer review to score research, rank it, or segregate works into accepts and rejects amplifies our biases and undermines peer review's scientific purpose. Embracing forms of peer review that produce no scores can make science more objective, just, and efficient.

We can make science more efficient, objective, and just by embracing forms of peer review that do not score research works, rank them, or segregate them into *accepts* and *rejects*.

Scoring research amplifies our implicit biases making us less objective. We cannot help but like works that are familiar in approach, language, and style to our own and those close to us; we cannot help but appreciate works motivated by a common belief system and that produce results that confirm our beliefs and hopes. When we must assign a score to qualities of the work we cannot help but activate these biases. Once activated, these biases propagate to our written feedback no matter how much we report only objective, purely factual observations. Of the innumerable possible factual observations we might make about a work, we cannot help but make more salient those that observations that confirm the fairness of how we expect to score the work. Thus, our natural biases against outsiders and outsider belief bias not only our scores, but the quality of our feedback.

<!-- When we have no scores to justify, we are more likely to find salient those observations that might most help the authors improve their work or help non-experts understand it. -->

<!-- Peer reviewers selected for their experience will find less familiar those works submitted by those who are new to a field and those who are underrepresented within a field, and have a less favorable view of work that challenges the field's strongly-held beliefs and prejudices. -->

It's unclear just how biased we are when reviewing works for acceptability, but the scant evidence available certainly does not suggest we are objective. In experiments by the NeuroIPS conference in 2014 and again in 2021, half of the works selected for acceptance by one set of peer reviewers were rejected by parallel sets of reviewers.[^consistency] It's fashionable to refer to this inconsistency as *randomness*, but doing so perpetuates a myth that harm is evenly distributed and diminishes over time. Our bias against underrepresented researchers and unpopular ideas may actually grow worse as today's peer reviews determine who survives to become tomorrow's peer reviewers.[^amplify]

We can provide more objective feedback for research when reviewing it without scoring it, providing feedback to inform rather than justify a score. Such *informative* review avoids activating the biases triggered by scoring.

*Informative* review is something many of us are already accustomed to performing. Many of us review friends' and colleagues' work, often as they prepare to submit that work for inclusion in journals and conferences. To help meet those deadlines we may provide feedback in days, sometimes in as little as hours, helping them to identify problems they may have overlooked, noting wording that might mislead or confuse, and suggesting ways to clarify and improve their work and how they present it.

Alas, informative review is most readily available to those of us who are already well established in our field and have other insiders to call upon for help. The less fortunate may only have access to feedback through submission to conferences and journals, many of which which reject the majority of submissions, provide feedback written to justify those rejections, and take months to provide this ‘help’. When we only review outsiders' work to evaluate it for publication, and only provide informative review to those close to us, we our ‘service’ amplifies the systemic bias faced by underrepresented groups, newcomers, and other outsiders.

We can start to make science at least a little more objective, just, and efficient by ensuring *author-assistive* informative peer review is as broadly accessible as peer review to evaluate whether work is worthy of publication. This would ensure a more equitable distribution of fast, helpful feedback on scientific research: feedback written to help authors rather than justify rejection; feedback that need not await a committee to reach consensus on a collection of acceptance decisions.[^pre-experimental-review] 

[^pre-experimental-review]: We can also offer author-assistive review to researchers *before* they conduct their research, helping them refine their hypotheses and improve their experimental designs before they incur the risks and costs of running experiments. The current practice of rejecting experimental designs at publication time is unnecessarily wasteful and frustrating for all involved.

Next, we can offer *audience-assistive* informative peer review, in which we direct our independent feedback to the work's audience to help prevent them from being confused or mislead. Such review allows authors seek independent scrutiny to establish their work's credibility without the biases and delays of publication review.

Isolating scrutiny of a work's credibility from its suitability for publication is important because attempting to compress both into a binary *accept* or *reject* outcome is harmful: acceptances are misconstrued as blanket endorsements, causing readers to overlook works' shortcomings; rejections are misconstrued as indictments.

When writing reviews to be shared with the work's audience empowers us to differentiate extremely meticulous findings from those that are somewhat credible, those that are the glaringly wrong, and everything in between. When some of the findings in a research work are significantly more credible than others, we need not assign them to a common fate.[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished] By providing nuance we can help a work's audience learn why some results are more credible than others and become more savvy in identifying such issues on their own.

We can provide audience-assistive informative peer review after work is made public, making our reviews public upon completing them, or before a work is made public on the condition that our reviews become public when the work does. Giving *all* authors the opportunity to establish the credibility of their work independent of publication review can help reduce the impact of the biases implicit in publication review. Further, making reviews public can also help make bias easier to detect and mitigate.

Whereas publication review can reinforce knowledge asymmetries, audience-assistive feedback is designed to reduce knowledge asymmetries, reducing the knowledge gap between authors and audience.

We can be more selective in accepting invitations to perform publication review. Is review for journal more service to a systemically biased stratification system? Would conferences be better off letting attendees choose what is worth attending rather than relying on what experts think the audience wants?.

<!--  Whereas competitive forms of peer review require us to compare the subjective importance of others' research questions, informative review only asks scientists to use the same skills used to conduct and present their own research.   -->

<!--  The skills needed to conduct informative peer review are those we use to put conduct our own research: examining others' work and sharing our insights into it for a broad audience. The skills we already use in collaborations are skills we can use to persuade authors to improve their work: explaining how revisions could improve the work and even instructions to help realize those improvements. (We should also update our reviews when authors make improvements that deserve acknowledgement.) -->

<!-- When we perform informative peer review, we are serving to help a work's audience understand the work better and to help the work's authors improve it. Serving people is more fulfilling than serving the -->
Conducting informative peer review allows us to serve science without the hazards of ranking and rejecting much (often most) of the work we review. We need not fear the corrupting influence of power over others' work once we have abdicated it.[^anonymity] Whereas competitive peer review can reinforce imbalances, giving those who already have status in a research community power to distribute status to work they like, informative peer review tasks us with helping authors and with reducing the knowledge imbalance between authors and their audience.

[^anonymity]: The corrupting influence of power over others' work can be compounded when we exercise that power anonymously.  Informative peer review can be used with anonymous or named authors, and with anonymous, pseudonymous, or named reviewers. Naming authors prior to reviewers' initial review may make them less objective. Reviewers may be more comfortable being named by default given that they don't have to fear being blamed for rejecting a paper.


 <!-- We can also be kinder to our fellow reviewers when we do not have to haggle over outcomes.  -->

Seeking informative review prior to submitting for selective review also serves a greater purpose: subverting the pretense that segregating works into accepts and rejects advances sciences, or is somehow necessary to the pursuit of scientific knowledge. We advance science when we examine a work's integrity, helping authors to find missteps they may have overlooked, and when we provide feedback that helps clarify their work so others can better understand it. Segregating works confers prestige to those whose works are deemed noteworthy or interesting, but it does not further science. We tally acceptances to evaluate scientists, and this may provides a veneer of objectivity when evaluating candidates for jobs or promotions, but aggregating systemically-biased outcomes does not remove subjectivity, it only disguise it.




We chase acceptances to accumulate prestige, and tally others' acceptances to gauge their success, but these pursuits are tangential to scientific progress and often deleterious to it. When we serve on peer review committees that produce accepts and rejects, ours is the outsourced labor that allows institutions to score candidates for jobs or promotions without understanding their work. Tallying acceptances provides a veneer of objectivity, but aggregating systemically-biased outcomes only disguises our subjectivity.

Journals and conferences that brand themselves as “highly-selective” do so by increasing the ratio of rejects to accepts. Institutions screening job candidates by their acceptances, effectively outsourcing the job of reading and understanding candidates' contributions to peer review committees. Some purport this makes hiring more objective, but aggregating systemically biased outcomes does not produce objectivity, only deniability .

Many of us will still be obligated to seek the acceptance of a *competitive* review, as career advancement often requires us to accumulate acceptances from exclusive publications and present at exclusive conferences[^reviewers-are-biased-sample]. However, we can still benefit from informative review.


But introducing informative review is the catalyst we need to trigger that reform. By demonstrating that scientific peer review need not produce accepts and rejects can we subvert the very pretense that ranking others is service to science. 

Still, those planning to submit for competitive review will not be able to write solely for their intended audience, but will still need to write to court acceptance from reviewers and minimize our risk of rejection. Seasoned researchers preparing work for competitive peer review write to avoid rejection without even thinking about it, often not realizing how differently we might write were it not necessary to do so. We open our papers with introductions written to convince reviewers that our work is worthy of their interest, not to help potential readers decide whether our work is what they are looking for. We cite superfluous works[^citation-counts] by potential reviewers, use unnecessary jargon coined by potential reviewers, and employ frameworks invented by potential reviewers, all to signal that we are experts in the field who appreciate their contributions and to humble ourselves before them.

And only by bypassing competitive review can we be free of from the cycle in which works are rejected by one set of reviewers only to be submitted to another set of reviewers, then another, and another. Such cycles require diligent authors to revise work for each re-submission to appeal to a new peer review committee with different members, expectations, interests, and paper formatting rules. Each such re-submission requires a new set of reviewers to replicate the work of prior reviewers from scratch, even if work is effectively unchanged from submission to prior reviewers.


We constructive feedback not attached to a reject outcome could help reduce the number of aspiring scientists who exit the field because they are uncomfortable promoting their work as important, or who are too “thin-skinned” or “insufficiently perseverant” to dedicate time and effort to position their work as worthy of praise. While the ability to overcome challenges is an asset in science and most professions, expecting persistence in the face of negative feedback biases survival in favor of those best able to ignore evidence, which are exactly those we should least want to be scientists.[^selection-of-scientists]



<!-- Opting for informative scientific peer review and self publishing could dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific discourse, allowing time-critical work to be scientifically evaluated in days instead of months. -->


  <!-- When we submit for competitive review, we will be obligated to attach the reviews .  The feedback we receive from informative review can strengthen our work before submission for competitive review. Sharing the reviews and evidence of our efforts to satisfy those reviewers can strengthen our case for acceptance. If we have satisfied informative reviewers we are less likely to question our own competence when competitive reviewers reject our work due to disinterest. -->



<!-- We should make science more welcoming of those who see zero sum games as antithetical to an endeavor meant to increase *everyone's* knowledge. -->

<!--

    In the short-run, informative peer review prior to competitive peer review makes a work more competitive.

    In the long-run, informative peer review allows us to separate the cooperative goals of furthering science from the competitive goals of status and stratification. Separate the industry of science from the act of science.
    (Informative peer review provides public goods: helping authors improve their work and helping others understand it.
    Competitive peer review supports the stratification system that supports the industry of science, but doesn't serve science itself.)
 -->
But we should not just work to offer informative peer review to others, we should take advantage of it ourselves.

In the short term, informative peer review gives us an avenue to seek constructive feedback to validate our work, improve it, and even give it a leg up before it must compete for acceptances.

In the long term, it helps us reckon with the stratification system the scientific community has built on top of competitive peer review.





<!-- The feedback we receive from informative review can strengthen our work before submission for competitive review.

The only way to truly address the harms of competitive review is for science to re-evaluate our dependence on it and the stratification system we've built on top of it. It is we who collectively perpetuate the systems that demand that we rank peers' research, and in so doing rank our peers themselves. Introducing marginally less subjective forms of peer review only serves to perpetuate this system and the illusion that we might someday find criteria that are objective.

<!-- Counting acceptances may save us all some time in evaluating which papers are worth reading and which candidates are worth interviewing, but the tax this system imposes on our time costs much more time than it saves. -->

[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes]: Evaluating experiments by their outcomes encourages authors to highlight those hypotheses that yielded statistically significant results than those that didn't, hypothesize potentially significant results only after seeing data [(HARKing)](./Recommended-Readings.md#harking-hypothesizing-after-the-results-are-known), and to engage in [other irresponsible scientific practices](./Recommended-Readings.md#rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility).

[^consistency]: See [recommended readings](./Recommended-Readings.md#the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment) for a summary of the The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment or go directly to the [primary source](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/). The first experiment was for [NIPS 2014](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/CallForPapers) (the conference would be renamed NeurIPS), which had a call for papers with a section for evaluation criteria which stated “submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity.” The 2021 call for papers listed no evaluation criteria.

[^subjective-integrity]: To understand why integrity is inherently subjective, consider an experiment that attempts to prove a hypothesis by rejecting a null hypothesis. The experiment does not consider or attempt to test a third hypothesis that would also lead the null hypothesis to be rejected. If a reviewer considers that third hypothesis sufficiently implausible, the third hypothesis does not impact the integrity of the experiment. If a reviewer considers the third hypothesis sufficiently plausible, they might conclude that the experiment should have been designed to disprove it as well.

[^open-peer-review]: Informative peer review is similar to [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) in that reviews are published. Open peer review often a form of competitive peer review and may only make requirements of publishing reviews for accepted papers.

[^social-contract]: The social contract of informative peer review requires authors to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, informing their audience of what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.  While the requirement to share reviews burdens authors who receive feedback they believe to be misleading or outright malicious, they can rebut that feedback themselves or ask other reviewers, or even outside experts, to do so.

[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]: The originally-intended audience of a work may not not see the reviews if authors choose not to publish it.

[^citation-counts]: Reviewers' expectations for ever-increasing numbers of cited works, and our need to exceed their expectations for citation counts when submitting work, have caused the bibliographies we produce to evolve like peacocks' trains: vast assemblies of plumage, most of which serve no function but to attract the admiration of those who co-evolved to prize it.

[^selection-of-scientists]: Some have even argued that natural selection favors scientists whose “poor” methods “produce the greatest number of publishable results” which leads to “increasingly high false discovery rates”. See [recommended readings](./Recommended-Readings.md/#the-natural-selection-of-bad-science) or go directly to the primary source by [Smaldino and McElreath](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160384).


[^reviewers-are-biased-sample]: Alternatively, conferences could offer presentation spaces of various sizes and allocate those spaces by audience interest instead of competitive peer review. Review committees are, after all, a biased sample of likely attendees.
