The most valuable forms of scientific peer review do not require us to score others' work, rank it, or decide whether it is worthy of publication. We can make science more efficient, objective, and equitable by making such scoreless peer review available to more than just our students, colleagues, and friends.

<!-- We can make science more efficient, objective, and equitable by making ourselves available to peer review others' works without evaluating whether those works are publishable, without ranking them, and without doing anything else that would require us to score them. -->

Removing scoring transforms peer review because scoring triggers and amplifies our implicit biases. We are predisposed to appreciate works that are familiar in approach, language, and style to our own work. We are predisposed to trust results that confirm our existing beliefs and hopes. Once triggered, these biases can propagate from our scores to our written feedback, no matter how objective we try to be. Even if provide feedback containing only factual observations, we can only report a small fraction of the facts we observe, and facts that confirm the fairness of our scoring intentions will seem more salient. Newcomers, underrepresented groups, and other outsiders may not only get lower scores, but worse feedback.

It's unclear just how biased we are producing peer review scores and decisions, but the scant evidence available certainly does not suggest we are objective. In experiments by the NeuroIPS conference in 2014 and again in 2021, half of the works selected for acceptance by one set of peer reviewers were rejected by parallel sets of reviewers.[^consistency] It's fashionable to refer to this inconsistency as *randomness*, but doing so perpetuates the assumption that inconsistency is unbiased (impacting everyone equally) and diminishes over time. It dismisses the possibility of systemic bias against underrepresented researchers and unpopular ideas, which grows worse as today's peer reviews determine who survives to become tomorrow's peer reviewers.

Removing the act of scoring eliminates a trigger that may activate or amplify our biases. Removing the scores, ranks, and acceptance choices eliminates the need to make our feedback match our (potentially-biased) choices.

One form of scoreless peer review many of us are already familiar with is *author-assistive* review: we examine work authored by students, colleagues, friends, and others to help make it better. We often provide feedback on short deadlines for work ready to be submitted to journals and conferences, sometimes in as little as hours. Whereas anyone can submit work to an open call for publication review, waiting months to receive feedback often written to justify a rejection outcome, *author-assistive* review is typically only available to those who know experts who owe them a favor.

If the reason we peer review is to serve science and the scientific community, surely we should make *author-assistive* review as accessible to our fellow scientists as the peer review we provide in service to publications.[^pre-experimental-review]

[^pre-experimental-review]: We should also offer to assist authors *before* they conduct experiments, helping them refine their hypotheses and improve their experimental designs prior to incurring the risks, costs, and time the experiments require. The current practice of reviewing and rejecting experimental designs at publication time, after the costs of conducting the experiment have been sunk, is wasteful and frustrating for all involved.

Alas, even if we do a better job of helping authors improve their work, many in their intended audience will treat the work as suspect until it has been for publication by a peer review committee. This assumption, which many of us help perpetuate, is problematic for many reasons: publications' often make decisions based on subjective criteria unrelated to credibility, such as ‘novelty’ and ‘significance’; those criteria can encourage authors to optimize for these criteria, reinforcing unscientific practices[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes]; most outright fraud escapes peer review. When research is scored and compressed into a binary outcome, *accepts* are misconstrued as endorsement and readers to overlook key limitations. 

*Audience-assistive* peer review gives independent experts the opportunity examine a work's credibility without scoring it. Addressing feedback directly to the work's audience empowers us to differentiate extremely meticulous findings from those that are somewhat credible, those that are the glaringly wrong, and everything in between. When some of the findings in a research work are significantly more credible than others, we need not assign them to a common fate.[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished] We need not produce *accepts*, which may be misconstrued as blanket endorsement and lead readers to miss key limitations. We need not produce *rejects* which may be misconstrued as indictments. We can provide nuance to help a work's audience learn why some results are more credible than others and become more savvy in identifying such issues on their own. 

**HERE**

Authors can request *audience-assistive* review to solicit scrutiny of their work's credibility without the biases of scoring and the delays that would be required if reviewers had to coordinate on a decision. Authors can invite scrutiny immediately after making their research public or beforehand, releasing their reviews along with their research. While audience-assistive review will certainly still have biases, when reviews are part of open discourse, and not part of science's shadow discourse, there is more opportunity to recognize when bias is present and find ways to mitigate it.

Reforming peer review has been a collective action problem: almost all of us know the zero-sum publication game exacerbates chance results [^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes], is biased, wasteful, and toxic, but we're required to keep playing, submitting works for publication for our students and junior colleagues even after we no longer need them to survive. Each time we conduct informative peer review we can take one small step to solving the problem.

The act of performing audience-assisted review helps subvert the premise that scientific research only becomes credible when it is accepted for publication. It subverts the very premise that publication review serves a scientific function. It does not.

Dedicating more time to conducting informative peer review will require us to be more selective in accepting invitations to perform publication review. It may lead us to question whether conferences really need our expertise to decide which work is of interest to attendees, or if we would all be better served if they asked prospective attendees which works they were interested in seeing, using that data to assign appropriately-sized presentation spaces. It may lead us to ask if the prestige of journals is still an efficient way to draw attention to great research by authors whose work might otherwise go unnoticed.


<!-- Dedicating more of our time to *author-* and *audience-assistive* review can also help us solve the collective-action problem that plagues science: how can we make peer review serve science when there are so many vested interests invested in the status quo. Prestigious journals and conferences are invested in exclusivity, which necessitates low acceptance rates and causes papers to be submitted to venue after venue. Employers use publication as a proxy of whom to interview, hire, and promote, as they present a veneer of objectivity to those unaware of the systemic bias inherent to publication review. Most of us are aware of these problems, but few of us feel empowered to do much about it.

<!--  Whereas competitive forms of peer review require us to compare the subjective importance of others' research questions, informative review only asks scientists to use the same skills used to conduct and present their own research.   -->

<!--  The skills needed to conduct informative peer review are those we use to put conduct our own research: examining others' work and sharing our insights into it for a broad audience. The skills we already use in collaborations are skills we can use to persuade authors to improve their work: explaining how revisions could improve the work and even instructions to help realize those improvements. (We should also update our reviews when authors make improvements that deserve acknowledgement.) -->

<!-- When we perform informative peer review, we are serving to help a work's audience understand the work better and to help the work's authors improve it. Serving people is more fulfilling than serving the -->
<!-- Conducting informative peer review allows us to serve science without the hazards of ranking and rejecting much (often most) of the work we review. We need not fear the corrupting influence of power over others' work once we have abdicated it.[^anonymity] Whereas competitive peer review can reinforce imbalances, giving those who already have status in a research community power to distribute status to work they like, informative peer review tasks us with helping authors and with reducing the knowledge imbalance between authors and their audience.

[^anonymity]: The corrupting influence of power over others' work can be compounded when we exercise that power anonymously.  Informative peer review can be used with anonymous or named authors, and with anonymous, pseudonymous, or named reviewers. Naming authors prior to reviewers' initial review may make them less objective. Reviewers may be more comfortable being named by default given that they don't have to fear being blamed for rejecting a paper. -->


 <!-- We can also be kinder to our fellow reviewers when we do not have to haggle over outcomes.  -->


<!-- 
Seeking informative review prior to submitting for selective review also serves a greater purpose: subverting the pretense that segregating works into accepts and rejects advances sciences, or is somehow necessary to the pursuit of scientific knowledge. We advance science when we examine a work's integrity, helping authors to find missteps they may have overlooked, and when we provide feedback that helps clarify their work so others can better understand it. Segregating works confers prestige to those whose works are deemed noteworthy or interesting, but it does not further science. We tally acceptances to evaluate scientists, and this may provides a veneer of objectivity when evaluating candidates for jobs or promotions, but aggregating systemically-biased outcomes does not remove subjectivity, it only disguise it.
 -->


<!-- 
We chase acceptances to accumulate prestige, and tally others' acceptances to gauge their success, but these pursuits are tangential to scientific progress and often deleterious to it. When we serve on peer review committees that produce accepts and rejects, ours is the outsourced labor that allows institutions to score candidates for jobs or promotions without understanding their work. Tallying acceptances provides a veneer of objectivity, but aggregating systemically-biased outcomes only disguises our subjectivity.

Journals and conferences that brand themselves as “highly-selective” do so by increasing the ratio of rejects to accepts. Institutions screening job candidates by their acceptances, effectively outsourcing the job of reading and understanding candidates' contributions to peer review committees. Some purport this makes hiring more objective, but aggregating systemically biased outcomes does not produce objectivity, only deniability .

Many of us will still be obligated to seek the acceptance of a *competitive* review, as career advancement often requires us to accumulate acceptances from exclusive publications and present at exclusive conferences[^reviewers-are-biased-sample]. However, we can still benefit from informative review. -->

<!-- 
But introducing informative review is the catalyst we need to trigger that reform. By demonstrating that scientific peer review need not produce accepts and rejects can we subvert the very pretense that ranking others is service to science. 

Still, those planning to submit for competitive review will not be able to write solely for their intended audience, but will still need to write to court acceptance from reviewers and minimize our risk of rejection. Seasoned researchers preparing work for competitive peer review write to avoid rejection without even thinking about it, often not realizing how differently we might write were it not necessary to do so. We open our papers with introductions written to convince reviewers that our work is worthy of their interest, not to help potential readers decide whether our work is what they are looking for. We cite superfluous works[^citation-counts] by potential reviewers, use unnecessary jargon coined by potential reviewers, and employ frameworks invented by potential reviewers, all to signal that we are experts in the field who appreciate their contributions and to humble ourselves before them.

And only by bypassing competitive review can we be free of from the cycle in which works are rejected by one set of reviewers only to be submitted to another set of reviewers, then another, and another. Such cycles require diligent authors to revise work for each re-submission to appeal to a new peer review committee with different members, expectations, interests, and paper formatting rules. Each such re-submission requires a new set of reviewers to replicate the work of prior reviewers from scratch, even if work is effectively unchanged from submission to prior reviewers.


We constructive feedback not attached to a reject outcome could help reduce the number of aspiring scientists who exit the field because they are uncomfortable promoting their work as important, or who are too “thin-skinned” or “insufficiently perseverant” to dedicate time and effort to position their work as worthy of praise. While the ability to overcome challenges is an asset in science and most professions, expecting persistence in the face of negative feedback biases survival in favor of those best able to ignore evidence, which are exactly those we should least want to be scientists.[^selection-of-scientists]

<!-- Opting for informative scientific peer review and self publishing could dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific discourse, allowing time-critical work to be scientifically evaluated in days instead of months. -->


  <!-- When we submit for competitive review, we will be obligated to attach the reviews .  The feedback we receive from informative review can strengthen our work before submission for competitive review. Sharing the reviews and evidence of our efforts to satisfy those reviewers can strengthen our case for acceptance. If we have satisfied informative reviewers we are less likely to question our own competence when competitive reviewers reject our work due to disinterest. -->



<!-- We should make science more welcoming of those who see zero sum games as antithetical to an endeavor meant to increase *everyone's* knowledge. -->

<!--

    In the short-run, informative peer review prior to competitive peer review makes a work more competitive.

    In the long-run, informative peer review allows us to separate the cooperative goals of furthering science from the competitive goals of status and stratification. Separate the industry of science from the act of science.
    (Informative peer review provides public goods: helping authors improve their work and helping others understand it.
    Competitive peer review supports the stratification system that supports the industry of science, but doesn't serve science itself.)

<!-- The only way to truly address the harms of competitive review is for science to re-evaluate our dependence on it and the stratification system we've built on top of it. It is we who collectively perpetuate the systems that demand that we rank peers' research, and in so doing rank our peers themselves. Introducing marginally less subjective forms of peer review only serves to perpetuate this system and the illusion that we might someday find criteria that are objective. -->

<!-- Counting acceptances may save us all some time in evaluating which papers are worth reading and which candidates are worth interviewing, but the tax this system imposes on our time costs much more time than it saves. -->

[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes]: Evaluating experiments by their outcomes encourages authors to highlight those hypotheses that yielded statistically significant results than those that didn't, hypothesize potentially significant results only after seeing data [(HARKing)](./Recommended-Readings.md#harking-hypothesizing-after-the-results-are-known), and to engage in [other irresponsible scientific practices](./Recommended-Readings.md#rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility).

[^consistency]: See [recommended readings](./Recommended-Readings.md#the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment) for a summary of the The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment or go directly to the [primary source](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/). The first experiment was for [NIPS 2014](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/CallForPapers) (the conference would be renamed NeurIPS), which had a call for papers with a section for evaluation criteria which stated “submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity.” The 2021 call for papers listed no evaluation criteria.

[^subjective-integrity]: To understand why integrity is inherently subjective, consider an experiment that attempts to prove a hypothesis by rejecting a null hypothesis. The experiment does not consider or attempt to test a third hypothesis that would also lead the null hypothesis to be rejected. If a reviewer considers that third hypothesis sufficiently implausible, the third hypothesis does not impact the integrity of the experiment. If a reviewer considers the third hypothesis sufficiently plausible, they might conclude that the experiment should have been designed to disprove it as well.

[^open-peer-review]: Informative peer review is similar to [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) in that reviews are published. Open peer review often a form of competitive peer review and may only make requirements of publishing reviews for accepted papers.

[^social-contract]: The social contract of informative peer review requires authors to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, informing their audience of what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.  While the requirement to share reviews burdens authors who receive feedback they believe to be misleading or outright malicious, they can rebut that feedback themselves or ask other reviewers, or even outside experts, to do so.

[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]: Further, when rejected work goes unpublished they disappear from scientific discourse, we can't learn from any mistakes that were made, and so the same mistakes and failed experiments can be re-run over and over. We bias research in favor of chance results.

[^citation-counts]: Reviewers' expectations for ever-increasing numbers of cited works, and our need to exceed their expectations for citation counts when submitting work, have caused the bibliographies we produce to evolve like peacocks' trains: vast assemblies of plumage, most of which serve no function but to attract the admiration of those who co-evolved to prize it.

[^selection-of-scientists]: Some have even argued that natural selection favors scientists whose “poor” methods “produce the greatest number of publishable results” which leads to “increasingly high false discovery rates”. See [recommended readings](./Recommended-Readings.md/#the-natural-selection-of-bad-science) or go directly to the primary source by [Smaldino and McElreath](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160384).


[^reviewers-are-biased-sample]: Alternatively, conferences could offer presentation spaces of various sizes and allocate those spaces by audience interest instead of competitive peer review. Review committees are, after all, a biased sample of likely attendees.


[^figure-out-where-to-put-this-footnote]: Whereas publication review can reinforce knowledge asymmetries, audience-assistive feedback is designed to reduce knowledge asymmetries, reducing the knowledge gap between authors and audience.
