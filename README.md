# What We Each Can Do to Fix Peer Review

<!-- Concepts lost

The most objective and scientifically valuable forms of peer review do not require us to score others' research work, rank it, or decide whether it is worthy of publication. Yet, the most broadly available form of peer review, publication review, makes scoring central to the detriment of objectivity. <!-- We can make each make science more objective, equitable, and efficient by making ourselves at least as accessible to conduct *scoreless* peer review as we are for publication review. --> Reforming peer review may seem like a collective-action problem, but it need not be: any one of us can make science more objective, equitable, and efficient by making ourselves as available to conduct *scoreless* peer review as we are for publication review.

Scoring detracts from objectivity because it amplifies our implicit biases: we are predisposed to appreciate works that are familiar in approach, language, and style to our own work; we are predisposed to trust results that confirm our existing beliefs and hopes. Scoring requires us to quantify our sense of how much the work should be appreciated, trusted, or otherwise valued, which we cannot do in isolation of our biases. These biases can then propagate from our scores to our written feedback. Even if we take pains to be objective, such as by ensuring our written feedback is strictly factual, we can only report a small fraction of the facts we observe, and facts will seem more salient when they confirm the fairness of our scoring intentions. 
<!-- Newcomers, underrepresented groups, and other outsiders may not only get lower scores, but worse feedback. -->

We do not know the extent to which our biases influence our peer review scores, decisions, and feedback, but the scant evidence available certainly does not suggest that we are objective. In experiments by the NeuroIPS conference in 2014 and again in 2021, half of the works selected for acceptance by one set of peer reviewers were rejected by parallel sets of reviewers.[^consistency] It's fashionable to refer to this inconsistency as ‘*randomness*’, but doing so is unscientific and harmful, perpetuating the assumption that our inconsistency is unbiased (uniformly distributed) and diminishes in impact over time and scale. The word ‘randomness’ implicitly rejects the possibility of systemic biases, such as those against underrepresented researchers and unpopular ideas, which grow worse as today's peer reviews determine who survives to become tomorrow's peer reviewers.

Excising scoring from peer review cannot make us unbiased, but it can excise a trigger likely to subconsciously activate and amplify our biases, and it can excise the influence of scoring on our written feedback. While *scoreless* peer review cannot help journals and conferences choose which works to publish, it can serve the two *scientific* purposes we most often use to motivate peer review: helping authors improve their research work and helping evaluating its credibility.

Helping others improve research already motivates many of us to informally conduct scoreless peer review for students and colleagues. We scrutinize their work to catch errors, offer clarifications, and suggest other ways to make their work better. We seek *author-assistive* peer review from others to make our work better, often prior to submitting that work for publication review. 

Alas, social norms of offering author-assistive review to those we know, and publication review to everyone else, make expert author-assistive peer review far less broadly accessible than publication review. Insiders have access to experts willing to donate their time while others may have no choice but to get feedback by submitting their work to journals or conferences. Those insiders get constructive feedback quickly, whereas outsider may wait months longer only to receive feedback written to justify a rejection outcome.[^mostly-rejections]

If we want to ensure our well-intentioned service to others does not unwittingly disadvantage underrepresented groups and other outsiders, we should each make ourselves at least as accessible for *author-assistive* peer review as we are for publication review.[^pre-experimental-review]

[^pre-experimental-review]: We should also offer to assist authors *before* they conduct experiments, helping them refine their hypotheses and improve their experimental designs prior to incurring the risks, costs, and time the experiments require. The current practice of reviewing and rejecting experimental designs at publication time, after the costs of conducting the experiment have been sunk, is wasteful and frustrating for all involved. Pre-experimental review and registration of experimental designs can increase the chance that null results will be published. A [2018 examination](https://psyarxiv.com/3czyt) of 127 bio-medical and psychological science registered reports (pre-registered studies) showed a 61% null result rate, as opposed to a typical 5-20% null result rate for studies published in venues that did not require pre-registration.

Evaluating the credibility of research work is also a goal we can achieve through scoreless peer review, as using publication review for this purpose is problematic. Publications' acceptance criteria include factors such as ‘novelty’ and ‘significance’ that are not only unrelated to credibility, but subvert it by rewarding unscientific practices and chance results.[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes] Acceptances are too often misconstrued as endorsements that lead readers to overlook key limitations. Outright fraud is rarely detected by publication review and often benefits from its endorsement. And, since publication review requires scoring, under-represented groups and other outsiders will find it harder to establish that their work is credible through publication than insiders will.

The scoreless means to examine a work's credibility is *audience-assistive* peer review, in which we address our feedback to the work's audience to help them understand the work and any issues that might impact its credibility. Writing gives us the nuance to differentiate extremely meticulous findings from those that are somewhat credible, those that are glaringly wrong, and everything in between.[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]. Writing gives us the opportunity to help the audience develop the skills to identify strengths and weaknesses of research results themselves. And while audience-assistive reviewing will never be free from bias, the reviews become part of science's open discourse, presenting opportunities for others to recognize and mitigate any bias that might go unaddressed if left within the shadow discourse of confidential publication review.

Audience-assistive review has other benefits. It free authors write to write for their audience, who will ultimately judge their work, rather than to appeal to reviewers.[^written-for-reviewers] Audience-assistive review can operate more quickly than publication review because it does not require reviewers to coordinate on decisions, though reviewers may choose to update their feedback in response to others' reviews.

As with author-assistive review, we should each make ourselves as accessible for *audience-assistive* peer review as publication review. We all will benefit from a faster and more objective means to have the credibility of their work vetted, and we will reduce the disadvantage that under-represented groups and outsiders have in establishing the credibility of their work through publication review. We should make audience-assistive review available to authors immediately after their research is public, adding our feedback to the public discourse, and before authors are willing to share it publicly, which we may condition on our feedback being made public when the research is.[^anonymity]

In addition to making ourselves more available as scoreless peer reviewers, we should  volunteer for the administrative work required to make scoreless peer reviewing more broadly available, as we do when serving as editors or program chairs for journals and conferences. 

Dedicating time to scoreless peer review may force us to be more selective in volunteering for publication review. As more work is submitted to conferences with audience-assistive peer reviews already weighing in on their credibility, we may re-evaluate whether our time is well spent helping conferences choose which works attendees will see; prospective attendees might be better served if the conferences asked *them* which works they want to see. As more works our submitted to journals after audience-assistive peer review, we may re-evaluate whether this service is the best way to draw attention to important works that might otherwise go unnoticed.[^fashion-shows]

[^fashion-shows]: As we fulfill the scientific goals of peer review prior to publication review, and publication review becomes merely a means of achieving recognition, more of us may feel uncomfortable selecting the latest fashions for display on the science industry's runways.


<!-- We may find it easier to reckon with concerns about whether publication review is a fair way to evaluate people. -->

So long as those who employ scientists use recognition from journal and conference publications to make hiring and promotion decisions, many of us will feel pressured to submit to our work for their publication reviews and to serve them as reviewers. Reforming peer review has been a challenging collective-action problem because most research works have at least one author whose career advancement requires such recognition.

The key to reforming peer review may be to disentangle the competing goals of helping authors improve their work, establishing a work's credibility, and evaluating work for recognition. We can broaden access to the scientific functions of peer review by broadening access to author- and audience-assistive review. Perhaps in so doing we can also undermine the pretense that evaluating research for recognition is in any way essential to, or even compatible with, the progress of science.

<!-- By serving the scientific functions of peer review outside of publication review, we can chip away at the scientific veneer that justifies the use of our time to publication review to distribute attention and career advancement. -->

[^anonymity]: The corrupting influence of power to score others' work can be compounded when we exercise that power anonymously. Audience-assistive peer review can be performed anonymously, but there may be less reason to when reviews do not produce scores or outcomes.

[^evaluating-experiments-by-their-outcomes]: Evaluating experiments by their outcomes encourages authors to highlight those hypotheses that yielded statistically significant results than those that didn't, hypothesize potentially significant results only after seeing data [(HARKing)](./Recommended-Readings.md#harking-hypothesizing-after-the-results-are-known), and to engage in [other irresponsible scientific practices](./Recommended-Readings.md#rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility).

[^consistency]: [The NeurIPS 2021 Consistency Experiment](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/12/08/the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment/) followed the earlier experiment at [NIPS 2014](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/CallForPapers) (the conference would be renamed NeurIPS). The 2014 call for papers stated “submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity” whereas the 2021 call for papers listed no evaluation criteria.

[^mostly-rejections]: Since journals and conferences compete to be exclusive, those submitting to the publications with the most experts can expect the highest rejection rates.

[^subjective-integrity]: To understand why integrity is inherently subjective, consider an experiment that attempts to prove a hypothesis by rejecting a null hypothesis. The experiment does not consider or attempt to test a third hypothesis that would also lead the null hypothesis to be rejected. If a reviewer considers that third hypothesis sufficiently implausible, the third hypothesis does not impact the integrity of the experiment. If a reviewer considers the third hypothesis sufficiently plausible, they might conclude that the experiment should have been designed to disprove it as well.

[^open-peer-review]: Audience-assistive peer review is similar to [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) in that reviews are published. Open peer review often a form of publication peer review and may only make requirements of publishing reviews for accepted papers.

[^social-contract]: The social contract of informative peer review requires authors to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, informing their audience of what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.  While the requirement to share reviews burdens authors who receive feedback they believe to be misleading or outright malicious, they can rebut that feedback themselves or ask other reviewers, or even outside experts, to do so.

[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]: Further, when rejected work goes unpublished they disappear from scientific discourse, we can't learn from any mistakes that were made, and so the same mistakes and failed experiments can be re-run over and over. We bias research in favor of chance results.

[^written-for-reviewers]: Research works today are often more written for reviewers than a work's true audience, at a cost both to that audience and to authors. For example, reviewers' expectations for ever-increasing numbers of cited works, and our need to exceed their expectations for citation counts when submitting work, have caused the number of citations to grow out of hand. Bibliographies have evolved like peacocks' trains: vast assemblies of plumage, most of which serve no function but to attract the admiration of those who co-evolved to prize it.

[^selection-of-scientists]: Some have even argued that natural selection favors scientists whose “poor” methods “produce the greatest number of publishable results” which leads to “increasingly high false discovery rates”.

[^figure-out-where-to-put-this-footnote]: Whereas publication review can reinforce knowledge asymmetries, audience-assistive feedback is designed to reduce knowledge asymmetries, reducing the knowledge gap between authors and audience.
