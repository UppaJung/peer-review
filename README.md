# Rejecting *Reject* in Scientific Peer Review

Scientific peer review should *advance* science. It should promote and protect the integrity of scientific research by identifying missteps, errors, and other causes for concern that might otherwise go undetected or undisclosed. It should empower scientists with others' expertise and insights to make us all better scientists and communicators.

But we often practice forms of peer review that can hinder science instead of advance it.

We conduct *competitive* peer review in which we pit research works against each other to vie for inclusion in exclusive publications, or for other forms of recognition. We maintain the pretense of advancing science, but pick winners using criteria that inevitably undermine integrity.[^undermine-integrity] We also maintain the pretense that our criteria are objective without evidence; in the few well-designed experiments of competitive peer review, [half of the works accepted by one review were rejected by a parallel review](./Recommended-Readings.md#the-neurips-2021-consistency-experiment).

Yet, even if we conducted peer review work non-competitively and for integrity alone, we could not segregate works into *accept* and *reject* outcomes objectively. Scientific integrity has many dimensions. Compressing them to a boolean is inherently subjective, necessarily lossy, and thus likely to mislead. Rejecting works with flaws is also not the only way, nor even the best way, to protect scientific integrity.

The allure of the *reject* is its prophylactic power to prevent deeply-flawed work from reaching an audience—an audience cannot be mislead by flawed work they never see. However, a *reject* does not cure a work's flaws, and its protection is limited to a single review. The rejected work's authors may still re-submit their work unchanged elsewhere or publish it without peer review. Further, when we choose not to exercise our power to reject a work we implicitly endorse it, making it easier for its audience to overlook any limitations and shortcomings that weren't sufficient to justify rejection.

When a *reject* does succeed in censoring flawed work, it conceals authors' missteps from those who might study them or learn from them, making it harder for science to learn from our collective mistakes and immunize ourselves against them.

The power to reject work can also subvert our objectivity as reviewers. The moment we start leaning toward an accept or reject outcome, [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) may lead us to favor observations that support that decision. We may unfairly ignore observations that support the alternative outcome, as such observations create dissonance with our belief that our decision is the fair objective outcome.

The surest way to avoid being corrupted by the power to reject work is to abdicate that power. The surest way to avoid the problems of compressing our evaluation of a work's integrity into a boolean is not to compress it. The surest way to ensure hide mistakes from those seeking to understand them is not to censor them. The surest way to avoid picking winners unfairly is not to pick them at all. Scientific advancement need not be a competition. The product of *scientific* peer review need not, and should not, be a decision to *accept* or *reject* a work.

Peer review should instead produce evaluations written to *inform* the work's authors *and* audience. To ensure the audience can benefit from those evaluations, authors who submit for this *informative* form of peer review should be required to share the reviews (similar to open peer review[^open-peer-review]) if and when they publish their work or otherwise share it with others.[^social-contract]

In such *informative* peer reviewer, reviewers could address their evaluations directly to the work's potential audience, to ensure that audience is not disadvantaged by lacking reviewers' expertise, or by lacking the time to read as diligently as reviewers are expected to. For deeply-flawed work, reviewers could make their concerns apparent to the work's audience, signalling a lack of credence equivalent to, or even exceeding, that which would be conveyed by a *reject*.[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished] When reviewing particularly meticulous work, reviewers may illuminate how the work exceeded standards expected for a mere *accept*. Whereas peer review that concludes with a *reject* only protects a work's audience from being mislead by exposure to the reviewed work, *informative* peer review could help to immunize consumers of science against other misleading content.

This skills specific to *informative* peer review, elucidating insights to inform a broad audience, are those we should expect fellow scientists to possess and be comfortable using. Our skills as scientific collaborators can also help us persuade authors to improve their work: explaining the value of doing so, providing constructive feedback to make improvements easier to realize, offering the promise to update our reviews to acknowledge genuine improvements. 

*Informative* reviews could still provide feedback authors may not want to hear. While authors would be obligated to share that feedback, they could rebut that which they disagree with, encourage other reviewers to address the disagreement, or even invite outside experts to do so.

Increasing the objectivity informative value of scientific peer review is just one of the many benefits of isolating it from segregating *accepts* and *rejects*.

Submitting work for *informative* review would empower authors to write for their intended audience, not to court acceptance from reviewers and minimize their chance of rejection. Seasoned researchers preparing work for competitive peer review write to avoid rejection out of habit. We open our papers with introductions written to convince disinterested reviewers that our work is worthy of their interest, not to help potential readers decide whether our work is what they are looking for. We cite superfluous works by potential reviewers, and use unnecessary jargon and frameworks introduced by potential reviewers, to signal that we are experts in the field who appreciate their contributions and to humble ourselves before them. Reviewers' exploding expectations for citation counts, and our need to exceed those expectations, have caused the bibliographies we produce to evolve like peacock's trains: vast assemblies of plumage, most of which serve no function but to attract the admiration of those who co-evolved to prize it.



Submitting work for *informative* review would also reduce the time authors need to wait for feedback, because most of the current delays is needed to compare competing submissions. To compare submissions, reviewers must evaluate a set of them and discuss them with other reviewers. A reviewer conducting an *informative* review need only read one work and may choose to share feedback without awaiting others' reviews. It's possible to create *informative* peer review committees for time-critical topics that could respond in days instead of months. We could dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific discourse.

Opting out of competitive peer review would save authors and reviewers time and effort. It would eliminate the cycle in which works are rejected by one set of reviewers only to be submitted to another set of reviewers, then another, and another. Such cycles require diligent authors to revise work for each re-submission to a new peer review committee with different members, expectations, interests, and paper formatting rule. Even if work is unchanged, each such re-submission requires a new set of reviewers to replicate the work of prior reviewers from scratch.

Researchers could also make science more efficient by submitting their experiments for *informative* peer review before running those experiments or collecting any data. They could use reviewers' feedback to improve their experimental methodologies before running their experiments. This could be especially useful for human-subjects experiments and other experiments that are expensive to re-run, or that have a potential for harm each time they are run. The current practice of seeking review after incurring an experiments costs and risks is wasteful.

Embracing *informative* peer review could also make science kinder and more inclusive. When peer review that is exclusively *informative*, reviewers can write for the benefit of the work's potential audience, not to convince fellow reviewers to agree on an acceptance decision, nor to convince authors that a decision is fair. We could expect more constructive and positive feedback from *informative* peer review, at least in aggregate, because reviewers would not need to concoct reasons to justify rejecting the majority of papers. Informative peer review does not conflate reviewers' subjective disinterest in a work, or sense that it lacks significance, with a lack of scientific integrity. Offering peer review that is not competitive could make science more inclusive, as reviewers are naturally biased to accept work by authors similar to themselves, whether its because the work addresses problems similar to their own or whether its because the writing uses a dialect similar to their own.

Embracing *informative* peer review would make science more transparent, and remove the injustice of giving those in power the corrupting power of anonymity.[^anonymity].

*Competitive* peer review was once necessary to restrict how much could be published and stored due to financial constraints: when research was printed on paper, traveled by mail, and took up space on shelves. It no longer is. Curation is also less necessary as we have evolved tools to filter the deluge of information competing for our attention, such as search engines and social sharing. Nor is *competitive* review truly necessary for conferences. Conferences could ask attendees which work they actually want to see, instead of what a biased[^reviewers-are-biased-sample] sample of attendees (disproportionately senior and powerful) think they should see.

We can make *informative* peer review available without prohibiting subsequent submission for *competitive* review, but its availability would hopefully make *competitive* review less necessary. It would remove the pretense that we need *competitive* review to protect integrity or signal credibility.

Making *informative* peer review available would help the scientific community better recognize the trade-offs of competitive review. While some people benefit from recognition, others are put off or disheartened by turning an endeavor meant to increase *everyone's* knowledge into a set of zero-sum games that pit us against each other. Competitive peer review is the most important building block supporting science's social stratification system. Scientists should be able to serve science through peer review without becoming complicit in it.


<!-- The predominance of negative feedback biases who becomes a scientist. The scientific community loses talented aspiring scientists who are uncomfortable promoting their work as important, or who are too "thin-skinned" or "insufficiently perseverant" to discard feedback that argues their work is unimportant. While the ability to overcome challenges is an asset in science and most professions, expecting persistence in the face of negative feedback causes at least two selection biases in who survives the process of becoming a scientist.

First, it makes those more comfortable promoting the importance of their work, or whose sheer self confidence allows them to dismiss negative feedback, most likely survive. Those who believe others will be interested the research they've conducted, and are most able to ignore reviewers' disinterest, may also be the most able to ignore experimental results that refute their preconceptions. Some have even argued that natural selection favors scientists whose “poor” methods “produce the greatest number of publishable results” which leads to “increasingly high false discovery rates” [[Smaldino and McElreath]](./Recommended-Readings.md/#the-natural-selection-of-bad-science). -->


<!-- Some will welcome the opportunity to seek out scientific peer review, and review others' work, without becoming complicit in the toxicity of making research compete for recognition and prestige. -->
<!-- Some of us will still want to seek out the prestige that comes from presenting at an exclusive conference, publishing in an exclusive journal, or from other awards and recognition. Others may feel compelled to seek out such recognition by the expectations of co-authors or feel it's necessary for career advancement. We can still seek out *informative* review first. We could then revise our work and demonstrate that we had already responded to expert feedback before submitting for competitive review.  -->

Stuart Schechter wrote this article with the inspiration and help of many (some noted [here](./Acknowledgements.md)). Those who might dismiss Stuart's arguments by concluding that he is sort of mad scientist would be wise to consider an alternate hypothesis, that they may have only seen him mildly aggrieved. You can follow him at [@MildlyAggrievedScientist@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@MildlyAggrievedScientist).


[^undermine-integrity]: Rejecting work that isn't significant encourages authors to inflate their contributions, hypothesize potentially significant results only after seeing data [(HARK)](./Recommended-Readings.md#harking-hypothesizing-after-the-results-are-known), and engage in [other irresponsible scientific practices](./Recommended-Readings.md#rein-in-the-four-horsemen-of-irreproducibility)<p>Authors may elide mundane details of experimental designs that reviewers might find tedious, even if those details would be needed to replicate their experiments. Authors may highlight experiments or tests that yielded a statistically significant result and dedicate less space to those that reviewers will find less interesting. Authors may be tempted to deceive others, and even themselves, into believing that hypothesis tests they conducted on data they found interesting were planned before they had seen the data (or [HARKing](./Recommended-Readings.md#HARKing-Hypothesizing-After-the-Results-are-Known)).</p><p>Authors may be tempted to aggrandize their research to look more important. In some fields (including [mine](./Notes.md#speculation)), researchers are even pressured by reviewers to go beyond factual reporting of results to speculate about their research's impact and importance.</p>

[^open-peer-review]: [Open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) encompasses a range of practices are released to the public, including competitive peer review where authors of rejected papers have no obligation to share reviews if their work is later published.

[^social-contract]: The social contract of *informative* peer review requires authors to publish the reviews along with the work. If authors want to publish a revision before the reviews are updated in response to it, or if reviewers are unwilling or unable to respond to it, authors must also share the versions last reviewed by each reviewer, informing their audience of what may have changed since each reviewer last updated their review.

[^rejects-invisible-if-unpublished]: The originally-intended audience of a work may not not see the reviews if authors choose not to publish it.

[^anonymity]: Informative peer review can be used with anonymous or named authors, and with anonymous, pseudonymous, or named reviewers. Naming authors prior to reviewers' initial review may make them less objective. Reviewers may be more comfortable being named by default given that they don't have to fear being blamed for rejecting a paper.

[^reviewers-are-biased-sample]: Reviewers are disproportionately older and more powerful than the general population of conference attendees. We should be suspect of those who believe that they are best able to choose which work should be modeled on science's more exclusive runways and which to leave hanging backstage. Runways may be engineered hills, but they are still poor hills for scientists to choose to die on.
