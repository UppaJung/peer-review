#### Regarding "*researchers are pressured by reviewers to go beyond factual reporting*"
As an example of how exclusionary peer review pressures authors to speculate beyond their factual findings, I will quote two of the three reviewers from my recent co-authored submission to the *2022 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security*.

Reviewer B complained that data tables with the exact wording survey questions and answers be replaced with charts to make space for the "critical reflection of the results and a discussion of the larger implications of the results."

Reviewer C wrote "I'd like to read the authors' thoughts about the findings and how they inform future research and product development."
